# *Robot Maze* Quiz

## Introduction

In this quiz, you have to write an algorithm that directs a fictitious robot out of a maze. Your robot knows to perform a few simple operations (see [IRobot](Maze.Library/IRobot.cs)). Each method stub in [IRobot](Maze.Library/IRobot.cs) contains a detailed specification in the inline C# documentation.

To solve the quiz, implement the method `MoveRobotToExit` in [RobotController.cs](Maze.Robot/RobotController.cs). You can check if your code is correct by running the unit tests in [Maze.Tests](Maze.Tests).

1. Everybody has to do his/her best to come up with a solution.

1. Earn one point for your grade by delivering a solution that passes all unit tests.

## Hints

1. Open the provided solution [Maze.sln](Maze.sln) in Visual Studio 2017 and use the included code as a starting point.

1. In Visual Studio, open the *Test Explorer*. You will see all the unit tests. Initially, some will fail because the implementation is missing. Your goal is to make sure that all tests become green.
